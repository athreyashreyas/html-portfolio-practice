    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am pursuing a degree in Economics and Computer Science from BITS Goa. My
      primary focus is on computer science and technology. I am proficient in
      C++, Java, Python, Scala, and TypeScript and can learn associated
      frameworks and technologies on the go. Notwithstanding IT and tech, I love
      everything business and finance-related and explore these fields whenever
      I can.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, I strive to work in a dynamic and diverse work environment
      where I learn and add value in copious amounts. I find nothing more
      satisfying than working on something worthwhile with a mission statement I
      wholeheartedly believe in. I love to trek, climb, and read in my free
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feel free to say hi anytime, especially if any of the above resonates with
      you.
