<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am pursuing a degree in Economics and Computer Science from BITS Goa. My
  primary focus is on computer science and technology. I am proficient in C++,
  Java, Python, Scala, and TypeScript and can learn associated frameworks and
  technologies on the go. Notwithstanding IT and tech, I love everything
  business and finance-related and explore these fields whenever I can.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, I strive to work in a dynamic and diverse work environment where I
  learn and add value in copious amounts. I find nothing more satisfying than
  working on something worthwhile with a mission statement I wholeheartedly
  believe in. I love to trek, climb, and read in my free time.

  Feel free to say hi anytime, especially if any of the above resonates with
  you.
